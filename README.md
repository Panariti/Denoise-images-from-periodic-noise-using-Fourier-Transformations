# Denoise-images-from-periodic-noise-using-Fourier-Transformations
This is a Java implementation of image denoising from periodic noise using Fourier Transformations.
-To test it use the class Transform. 
-In the energy landscape choose the points with the mouse where you want to filter.
-Click Apply IFT and see the results. If you want to apply more filters just close the current frame and apply filters again.
